This Spring project contains a Greeter class and a Test class for Greeter-Kata. 

Greeter Class: This class a greet function that takes a name as input and outputs a greeting in the format "Hello $Name.".

The application will exit when the user enters "exit", else the application will keep running. 

### Assumptions

2. If two names are entered i.e. "neymar jr" then the app will take "neymar jr" as one argument.

### Testing
To ensure that all requirements are met and the Greeter class functions correctly. Sample test cases should cover the various scenarios defined in the requirements, such as different times of the day and input names.
